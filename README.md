# algoDs
a complete algorithm and data structures repository
# Contributions are welcome:

Contribution guide:
1. Fork the repo
2. Implement the algorithm in your preferable language(Go, JavaScript, C/C++, Python, Rust)
3. Find an appropriate folder to put your algorithm code into (e.g /Mathematics/EulerTotient/Cpp)
4. Try to properly document code wherever possible and necessary
5. Also, if possible, put a commented section of test case and possible explanation for the output

Cheers!!
