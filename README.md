# algoDs
a complete algorithm and data structures repository
# Contributions are welcome:

Contribution guide:
1. Fork the repo
2. Find an appropriate folder to put your algorithm code into (e.g /Mathematics/EulerTotient/Cpp)
3. Try to properly document code wherever possible and necessary
4. Also, if possible, put a commented section of test case and possible explanation for the output

Cheers!!
